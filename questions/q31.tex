K-Means:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item maximizes the sum of within cluster variances
\item reaches the same final answer irrespective of the initialization.
\item cluster assignments are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.   % Ans
\item never converges to the global optima.
\item None of the above   % None

Consider a measure computed from the final answer of K-Means:
\[ J_k = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l} \sum_{x_i \in C_l} ||x_i - \mu_l||_2^2 \]

With increase in $k$

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item $J_k$ will monotonically increase
\item $J_k$ will monotonically decrease.    % Ans
\item It could increase first and then decrease.
\item It could decrease and then increase
\item None of the above.    % None

Consider a set of 10 2D points (i.e., $N=10, d=2$) $\{{\bf x_i}\}$ as
\[ \{ [-2,-1]^T, [-3,-2]^T, [0, -1]^T, [-1,0]^T, [2,3]^T, [-1,-2]^T, [3,2]^T, [3,3]^T, [1,1]^T, [2,2]^T \} \]
Cluster them into two clusters $K=2$. Initialize the K Means such that the first five samples are in cluster A and the
next 5 are in cluster B.

Write the final means as
\[ (x,y) \mbox{ and } (a,b) \]
