Consider the following question with multiple answers. Answer is mostly incorrect. Correctly answer in the space given with an answer approximately of equal length/detail (not an essay!).

{\bf Q: Consider an autoencoder where input and output are $x$. We train this network by minimizing
the MSE loss of predicted and actual, using BP. Why does not loss become zero?}

{\em Ans1: Neural networks can not learn identity function}

{\em Ans2: Training by backpropagation will never allow to make loss zero or near zero.}
