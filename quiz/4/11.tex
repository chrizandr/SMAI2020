Remember the SVM problem from the problems we solved in the class. (1D samples)
\[ (-1,+1), (0,-1), (+1,-1) \]
we geometrically solved the problem and saw the optimal primal solution as $w=-2$ and $b=-1$

Assume the samples were
\[ (-20,+1), (0,-1), (+20,-1) \]
geometrically solve and give the answer as \textit{w=------,b=------}
