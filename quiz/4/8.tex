Consider the following question with multiple answers. Answer is mostly incorrect. Correctly answer in the space given with an answer approximately of equal length/detail (not an essay!).

{\bf Q: We wish our neural network is small so that the number of parameters/memory is small. How do we achieve that, say for an MLP?}

{\em Ans1: We start with a single layer perceptron and keep on adding new layers/weights one at a time and see when do we get the acceptable performance}

{\em Ans2: We L2 regularize the MLP.}

{\em Ans3: We make small/tiny weights to zero and retrain}
