Consider the following question with multiple answers. Answer is mostly incorrect. Correctly answer in the space given with an answer approximately of equal length/detail (not an essay!).

{\bf Q: We can initialize all the weights of an MLP as equal (say 1.0). This is considered to be bad. Why?}

{\em Ans1: No; This is a perfectly fine initialization}

{\em Ans2: Yes; this is not a good initialization. Since weights are equal, we can not find the derivatives}

{\em Ans3: Yes; this is not a good initialization. Since weights are equal, all weights learn at constant speed and we will not get a sparse solution as network.}
