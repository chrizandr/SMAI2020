Consider the following question with multiple answers. Answer is mostly incorrect. Correctly answer in the space given with an answer approximately of equal length/detail (not an essay!).

{\bf Q: Consider the problem of running K Means with K=2 on the four points $(\pm 1, \pm 1)$. Is it true to say that this problem can have two optimal solutions as $C_1 = \{(+1,+1), (+1,-1)\}, C_2 = \{ (-1,-1), (-1,+1)\}$} And $C_1 = \{(+1,+1), (-1,+1)\}, C_2 = \{ (-1,-1), (+1,-1)\}$

{\em Ans1: Yes; it is true since both the clustering are identical.}

{\em Ans2: Yes; both have the same objective, and identical clusters.}

{\em Ans3: No; there is actually a third equal objective clustering
$C_1 = \{(+1,+1), (-1,-1)\} C_2 = \{ (-1,+1), (+1,-1)\}$}

{\em Ans4: No; out of the two possibilities, one is a global optima and the other one is only a local one.}
