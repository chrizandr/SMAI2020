Consider the following question with multiple answers. Answers are mostly incorrect. Correctly answer in the space given with an answer approximately of equal length/detail (not an essay!).

{\bf Q: Given the objective/loss of a neural network, why don't we differentiate with respect to the individual weights, equate to zero and find the optimal (may be local) solution in one step?}

{\em Ans1: Yes; it is feasible. We do not do this because back-propagation is simpler to implement in python.}

{\em Ans2: No; this is not possible. Because we do not know how to differentiate the loss with respect to individual weights.}
