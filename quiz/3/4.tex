Consider the following 10 samples used for training a Kernel SVM with $\kappa({\bf p}, {\bf q}) = ({\bf p}^T{\bf q})^2$.  Labels are also given.
\[ ([-1,-1]^T,+1), ([1,1]^T, +1) ([+3,+4]^T, +1), ([0,0]^T,-1) ([10,10]^T,-1) \]
\[ ([0,1]^T,+1), ([-10,-10]^T,-1) ([1,0]^T,-1),([-2.5,-3.5]^T,+1), ([4.5,6.5]^T,-1) \]
corresponding $\alpha$ are:
\[ 0,1,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,0\]
({\em $\alpha$ values are scaled/adjusted to make the numerical computation simpler!} )
Assume $b=0$.

Consider at the test time, we have a sample $[-1, -1]^T$.
Is this sample in positive class or negative class?
