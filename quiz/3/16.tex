Consider two quadratic kernels:  $\kappa_1({\bf p}, {\bf q}) = ({\bf p}^T{\bf q}+1)^2$ and $\kappa_2({\bf p}, {\bf q}) = ({\bf p}^T{\bf q})^2$.

Make the necessary minimal changes  (if any required) and rewrite as true sentences in the space provided. Avoid changing the words in bold.

{\bf $\kappa_1(\cdot, \cdot)$} is a {\em valid kernel}; and {\bf $\kappa_2(\cdot, \cdot)$} is a {\em invalid kernel};
